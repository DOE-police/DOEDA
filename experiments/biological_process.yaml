description:
  A recently developed class of three-level designs-definitive screening
  designs was employed to select a quadratic model that describes the effect of six
  input process parameters, including protein concentration, formaldehyde-to-protein
  ratio, lysine concentration, reaction duration, pH, and reaction temperature, on
  a formylation protein-crosslinking reaction.

  Blocking:
    Blocking an experiment means that the runs are grouped according to one or more factors, usually not controlled by the experimenters, such that all the runs are not randomized.
    The experiment is then separated in blocks, defined by the blocking factors.
    
  Center runs:
    Exprimental runs where all factors are set at the intermediate level (coded as 0).
    They are usually added in a design to provide an unbiased estimate of the variance or to perform lack-of-fit tests.
    Know aliases: center points, controls runs.

  Fractional factorial:
    A design that is the fraction of a full-factorial design.
    A full-factorial :math:`2^{k}` contains all combinations of the levels of :math:`k` factors.
    
  Full factorial:
    A full-factorial :math:`2^{k}` contains all combinations of the levels of :math:`k` factors. 

  RCBD:
    Randomized Complete Block Design, or RCBD, is a blocked design (see Blocking), where each treatment appears exactly once in each block. It is commonly used in argicultural field trials.

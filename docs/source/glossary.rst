  Fractional factorial:
    A design that is the fraction of a full-factorial design.
    A full-factorial :math: 2^{k} contains all combinations of the levels of :math: k factors.
    
  Center runs:
    Exprimental runs where all factors are set at the intermediate level (coded as 0).
    They are usually added in a design to provide an unbiased estimate of the variance or to perform lack-of-fit tests.
    Know aliases: center points, controls runs.

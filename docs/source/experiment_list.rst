  Aspergillus niger medium type:
    Five sources of nitrogen, six minerals, six enzyme inducers and one each of growth as well as product promotors were screened by Plackett-Burman design, consisting of a total of 20 experiments for the above 19 sources/categories of medium ingredients, for their effect on the production of alpha-galactosidase by Aspergillus niger MRSS 234 in solid state fermentation system.

  Biological process characterization:
    A recently developed class of three-level designs-definitive screening designs was employed to select a quadratic model that describes the effect of six input process parameters, including protein concentration, formaldehyde-to-protein ratio, lysine concentration, reaction duration, pH, and reaction temperature, on a formylation protein-crosslinking reaction.

  Ceramic strength:
    Compressive strength measurements were conducted on 32 macroporous biphasic calcium phosphate (MBCP) samples to evaluate the influences and interactions  of five synthesis factors: chemical composition, percentage of macropores, mean size of macropores, isostatic compaction pressure, and sintering temperature.

  Laser Etching:
    Average rank for the quality of ecthing on a small plastic plate, using a laser.

  Polyethylene film:
    The simultaneous effects of a range of additives and associated interactions on meltprocessing stability, processing discoloration, and long-term stability of a blown film-grade metallocene LLDPE (mLLDPE) were investigated by using a two-level factorial experimental design. The experiment was ran in blocks, where each block is a separate day, and the nine runs within each block were performed sequentially. This example was taken from chapter 2 of the book "A Comprehensive Guide to Factorial Two-level Experimentation" (2009) by Robert Mee.
